# Dev-Center-API
MongoDB API for How-To's, Users, and other non-3.0 API specific data persistence issues.

This app is strictly a RESTful API for the Dev Center, based on an express server. It is used to handle most of the data 
persistence outside of the OrderCloud Data Model, such as How-To guides (for sourcing the class content, tracking user 
progress,etc.) and User Messaging (notifications and general messaging/message boards).
